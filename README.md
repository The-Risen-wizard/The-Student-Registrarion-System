# The-Student-Registrarion-System


# Overview:
The Student Registration System is a web application that allows users to register students and manage their details efficiently. It provides a simple interface to add students, display registered students in a table, and delete students when necessary. The project uses HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript (with Local Storage) to store student information


# Features:

1)Student Registration: Users can input student details including name, ID, class, and roll number.

2) Data Storage: Student records are stored in Local Storage so that the data persists even after page refresh.

3) Table View: Displays the list of registered students dynamically.

4) Delete Functionality: Users can remove students from the list, and the data updates in Local Storage.

5) Responsive Design: The interface is built using Tailwind CSS for a modern and clean look.

6) Sticky Navbar: The navigation bar remains visible even while scrolling.


# Technologies Used:

1) HTML - Structure of the application

2) Tailwind CSS - For styling the UI

3) JavaScript - Handles logic for adding, deleting, and storing student data

4) Local Storage - Saves student data in the browser


# Usage:

2) View Registered Students: The table will display all registered students.

3) Delete a Student: Click the delete button next to any student to remove them from the list.

# Improvements & Future Enhancements:
